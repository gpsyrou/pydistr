## pydistr

Python package to compute, calculate and visualize some of the common discrete and continuous probability distributions.

### Definitions

1. **Probability Mass Function**: It's a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is _exactly_ equal to some value.

2. **Probability Density Function**: It's associated with continuous random variables and it must be integrated over an interval to yield a probability.
